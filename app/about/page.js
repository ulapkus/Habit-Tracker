      <h8>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Habit Haven</h8>
      <p>
        I'm Ula, the self-taught coder and creator behind this little corner
        of the internet. It's my mission to make building and maintaining
        habits a breeze.
      </p>
      <h7>ðŸš€ THE JOURNEY</h7>
      <p>
        Ever since I read "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg in 2020, I've
        been on a habit-tracking train. For a while, I tracked my habits by hand
        in a notebook. Every so often, I would browse the App Store for a
        similarly styled habit tracker as my own - but I never found anything
        that gave me the same satisfaction as my own. When I began teaching
        myself to code in 2022, I was determined to get to a point where I could
        build my own habit tracker - exactly as I had envisioned it. Fast
        forward to 2024, and I find myself wrapping up this project. I love that
        I have a product exactly how I like it. I use it every day!
      </p>
      <h7>ðŸ’» FROM ZERO TO HERO</h7>
      <p>
        As someone who started from scratch, every line of code in this app is a
        testament to the countless hours spent learning and refining. It's been
        a thrilling ride of trial and error, late-night debugging sessions, and
        the sheer joy of seeing an idea come to life on the screen.
      </p>
      <h7>ðŸŒŸ WHY HABIT HAVEN?</h7>
      <p>
        What sets Habit Haven apart? It's the result of my personal frustrations
        turned into a passion project. I wanted a habit tracker that's not just
        functional but pleasing to the eye and simple to use. So, I poured that
        enthusiasm into creating an intuitive, user-friendly experience that
        adapts to your unique journey of habit formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you enjoy looking back on your habit progress as much as I
        enjoyed creating this for you.
